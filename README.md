# IJSS19

This code reproduces the results of Colin &amp; Holland 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2018.08.004)

The calculations (root and minima finding) and plotting are performed separately (by IJSS19_calculate.py and IJSS19_plot.py, respectively) for efficiency. Additionally, the output of both scripts are included.

Note that Fig. 5-8 in the paper were produced in Mathematica, but are reproduced here in Python for completeness.
